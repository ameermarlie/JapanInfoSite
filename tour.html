Osaka Castle (大坂城 or 大阪城, Ōsaka-jō) is a Japanese castle in Chūō-ku, Osaka, Japan. The castle is one of Japan's most famous landmarks and it played a major role in the unification of Japan during the sixteenth century of the Azuchi-Momoyama period.
The main tower of Osaka Castle is situated on a plot of land roughly one square kilometre. It is built on two raised platforms of landfill supported by sheer walls of cut rock, using a technique called Burdock piling, each overlooking a moat. The central castle building is five stories on the outside and eight stories on the inside, and built atop a tall stone foundation to protect its occupants from attackers.
The Main Tower is surrounded by a series of moats and defensive fortifications. The castle has 2 moats (an inner & outer).

			Mount Fuji (富士山, Fujisan, Japanese: [ɸɯꜜ(d)ʑisaɴ] (listen)), or Fugaku, located on the island of Honshū,
			is the highest mountain in Japan, standing 3,776.24 m (12,389.2 ft). It is the second-highest volcano located on 
			an island in Asia (after Mount Kerinci on the island of Sumatra), and seventh-highest peak of an island on Earth. 
			Mount Fuji is an active stratovolcano that last erupted from 1707 to 1708. The mountain is located about 100 km (62 mi)
			southwest of Tokyo and is visible from there on clear days. Mount Fuji's exceptionally symmetrical cone, which is covered 
			in snow for about five months of the year, is commonly used as a cultural icon of Japan and it is frequently depicted in
			art and photography, as well as visited by sightseers and climbers.

			Itsukushima Shrine (厳島神社 (嚴島神社), Itsukushima-jinja) is a Shinto shrine on the island of Itsukushima (popularly known as Miyajima)
			, best known for its "floating" torii gate. It is in the city of Hatsukaichi in Hiroshima Prefecture in Japan, accessible from the mainland 
			by ferry at Miyajimaguchi Station. The shrine complex is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the Japanese government has designated 
			several buildings and possessions as National Treasures.
            The Itsukushima shrine is one of Japan's most popular tourist attractions. 
			It is most famous for its dramatic gate, or torii on the outskirts of the shrine,
			the sacred peaks of Mount Misen, extensive forests, and its ocean view.
